# Sidebar selection follows the transcript

## Goal
Make the sidebar show the current position: its selected row is the turn containing the transcript's selected section, and that row stays visible. Live updates add rows without disturbing this. The sidebar still cannot take focus; keys come in the next task, and this behaviour is what makes returning to the sidebar never jump.

## Spec excerpts
`SPEC.md` below is the cycle 2 specification. `spec/SPEC.md` is the base spec, which describes the application as built. Where the two conflict, `SPEC.md` wins.

From SPEC.md §6.3:

Selection looks and behaves like the session selector's lists (base spec §8.2, §4.1). Reuse `list_pane` where it fits.

| State | Appearance |
|---|---|
| Selected, sidebar focused | `>` in `primary` replaces the `●` (or the first `═`) in column 3, never inverted. Everything after it is one inverted band (`foreground` with reverse video, not bold) up to the right margin; the label, gaps and duration all take the band's style |
| Selected, sidebar unfocused | `>` in `secondary_foreground`, text bold in `secondary_foreground`, not inverted |
| Border | `ring` when focused, `border` otherwise |

- The list never wraps around.
- **While the transcript has focus, the sidebar's selection follows it:** the selected row is the turn containing the transcript's selected section, and it stays visible. This keeps the sidebar showing the current position, and returning to it never jumps. Pushing that selection to the sidebar produces no message.
- When the sidebar has focus and nothing is selected, it selects the first entry on the first move. An empty list has no selection, and its keys do nothing.

From SPEC.md §6.1 (the pane's own scrolling):

- **It stays in a fixed position:** scrolling the transcript never moves the pane. Only its own list scrolls, and only as far as needed to keep the selected row visible, as in the selector's lists.

From SPEC.md §6.6:

Sessions can have thousands of turns (base spec §9.2). Building rows must not lay out or render transcript blocks, and turn updates must not rebuild more than the rows that changed. The sidebar draws only the rows it shows, and a key press in the sidebar stays within the frame budget on the 100 MB fixture.

From SPEC.md §7:

Every task must pass:

```
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

Tasks that change parsing, the model or rendering must also stay within budget on:

```
cargo test --release -- --ignored budgets --nocapture
```

Snapshot changes are limited to the rows a task intends to change. A snapshot changed by accident is a failure, not something to accept. Two changes are expected to touch many snapshots, and those are still reviewed one by one: the shared duration format (§2.4) changes every snapshot showing a footer or selector-row duration of a minute or longer, and the sidebar changes every browser screen snapshot at 90 columns or wider.

From spec/SPEC.md §1.2:

The UI follows tui-realm's model: components turn events into messages, and one update function acts on them.

- **`App`** owns the `Application` and the domain state: config, theme registry and active theme, keymap, session index and stats, the open session's summary, watch handle and subagent stack, worker handles and the clipboard.
- **`Id`**: one enum variant per mountable component (§1.3).
- **`Msg`**: what happened, in application terms (`OpenSession(id)`, `CopyText(text)`, `PreviewTheme(id)`, `Quit`, …), never raw keys. Split it into nested enums per screen or concern once it grows.
- **`UserEvent`**: what the Ports deliver: index updates, stats results, session `ModelUpdate`s, search results. tui-realm requires `UserEvent: Eq + Clone`, so large payloads are `Arc`-wrapped and compared by a sequence number.
- **`App::update(Msg)`** is the only place that changes domain state, mounts and unmounts components, moves focus and pushes new data into components. It is a dispatcher: each `Msg` arm calls a small handler, grouped in modules by concern (selector, browser, copy/save/export, resume, theme, live updates). It never interprets keys.
- **`App::view`** only computes the screen layout (§4) and calls `Application::view(&Id, frame, area)` for each visible component, overlays last. It draws nothing itself.

Rules:
- Data flows **down** into components through `attr` (typed data via `AttrValue::Payload(PropPayload::Any(..))`, `Arc`-wrapped when large). Intent flows **up** as `Msg`. Components never see the `App`, and the `App` never reaches into a component's internals.
- No shared mutable state between components, or between a component and the `App`: no `Rc<RefCell<…>>`, `Arc<Mutex<…>>` or globals for UI state.
- Each piece of state has exactly one owner. The `App` owns domain state. Each component owns its presentation state (cursor, scroll offset, fold states, layout cache, prompt text). The `Transcript` also owns the open session's turns (§5.1), so a 100 MB session is held once (§9.2); the `App` forwards each `ModelUpdate` to it rather than keeping a copy. A `Msg` carries everything the `App` needs to act on it. For example, on `y` the transcript component computes the text as displayed and sends it in `CopyText`, so the `App` never has to read fold states.

From spec/SPEC.md §1.4:

- **Focus:** exactly one component has focus at a time, set by `App::update` through `Application::active`. In the selector, the pane keys of §6.6 move focus between `ProjectList` and `SessionList`. A focused component shows it through `Attribute::Focus` (e.g. the `ring` border, §8.2).
- **Overlays and prompts:** opening one mounts its component and gives it focus. Closing it unmounts it and returns focus to the component that had it before.
- **Keys go through the keymap.** A component's `on()` resolves the key with the shared keymap (§8.5), for its own context, to an action. The action becomes a `Cmd` (handled internally with `perform`) or a `Msg`. Components never match literal `KeyEvent`s, except that `Prompt` takes printable characters as text. This keeps remapping and the generated help overlay (§4.3) correct.
- **Global keys** (quit, `?`, `t`, `Ctrl-o`) are handled by `GlobalEvents`, which subscribes to them (`Sub` / `SubClause`) using the active keymap, instead of every component checking for them. Subscribers get events as well as the focused component, so a `SubClause` keeps them from firing while `Prompt`, `HelpOverlay` or `ThemeSelector` has focus. Those components handle their own keys (input mode, §6; `Esc` / `?` closes help). `Ctrl-c` always quits. In the selector, `t`, `?` and `q` still work (§6.6).
- **Mouse:** wheel and clicks act on the element under the pointer, whether or not it has focus (§6.9). The event goes to the topmost component drawn there, for example through mouse subscriptions whose row/column ranges are that component's area. That component turns the event into a `Cmd` or `Msg`.
  - While an overlay is open (selector, help, theme selector), the components under it get no mouse events, and a click outside the overlay closes it.
  - Component areas come from a pure layout function that `App::view` also uses. Subscriptions are refreshed from it when the screen or terminal size changes, never from inside `view`.
- **Ticks:** `Event::Tick` drives toast expiry, the `● live` marker and the redraw limit (§7.1).
- **Worker results** take one path: Port → `Event::User` → `GlobalEvents` (subscribed to all user events) turns it into a `Msg` → `App::update` applies it to domain state and pushes what changed to the components that display it (rows and stats to `ProjectList` / `SessionList`, `ModelUpdate`s to `Transcript`). Other components don't subscribe to worker events.

From spec/SPEC.md §6.3 (navigation):

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↓` / `j`, `↑` / `k` | Select next / previous section |
| `]` / `[` | Jump to next / previous turn block (User / Assistant / Compaction) |
| `Ctrl-d` / `Ctrl-u` | Scroll half a page down / up |
| `PgDn` / `PgUp` | Scroll a full page down / up |
| `g` / `Home`, `G` / `End` | Jump to start / end (`G` resumes following, §7.2) |

- `Ctrl-b` / `Ctrl-f` are deliberately not bound: `Ctrl-b` is tmux's default prefix.
- Selecting a section scrolls it into view. If the selected section is taller than the viewport, `j`/`k` first scroll through it a page at a time and only then move to the next section.
- Scrolling with page keys or the mouse wheel moves the selection to the topmost fully visible section when the current one leaves the viewport.

From spec/SPEC.md §7.2:

- **Follow when at bottom:** if the viewport is at the end of the transcript, new content scrolls into view automatically. If the user has scrolled up, the position is kept and a `↓ N new` indicator appears in the help line; `G` / `End` jumps to the end and resumes following.
- Updates to content already displayed (e.g. a tool result arriving for a pending tool call, or a streamed message growing) update the section in place. The current selection and fold states are preserved.
- A `● live` marker is shown in the browser header while the session is active: file/rows modified within the last 60 s, or OpenCode `time_idle` is null.

From spec/SPEC.md §8.1:

Two layers, modelled on ratcn's shadcn-inspired `Theme`:

1. **Base roles** (required in a theme file): `name`, `foreground`, `muted_foreground`, `background`, `surface`, `field`, `primary`, `primary_foreground`, `secondary`, `secondary_foreground`, `accent`, `destructive`, `destructive_foreground`, `warning`, `border`, `ring`, `cursor`.
2. **Component tokens** (optional overrides; each derived from a base role by default): see the table below.

| Token | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `user_title` | `primary` | `User` block title |
| `assistant_title` | `accent` | `Assistant` block title, model @ effort |
| `system_title` | `muted_foreground` | System / compaction block titles |
| `timestamp` | `muted_foreground` | Right-aligned block titles |
| `tool_description` | `foreground` | `> description` lines |
| `label` | `muted_foreground` | `Command:` / `Result:` labels |
| `command` | `foreground` | Command / tool input text |
| `output` | `muted_foreground` | Tool results |
| `error_output` | `destructive` | Failed tool results |
| `diff_added` / `diff_removed` | `primary` / `destructive` | Edit diffs |
| `thinking` | `muted_foreground` | Thinking text |
| `selection_marker` | `primary` | `▒` and `>` markers |
| `search_match` | fg `primary_foreground` on `primary` | Search hits (the only explicit background colour; the selector's focused selection uses reverse video, §8.2) |
| `help_key` / `help_text` | `primary` / `muted_foreground` | Help line and help overlay |
| `toast` | fg `foreground` on `surface` | Toast notifications |
| `syntax.*` | derived from `accent`, `primary`, `secondary`, `warning` | Code-block syntax highlighting |

Colours accept `#rrggbb`, ANSI names (`red`, `bright_blue`, …), ANSI indices (`0`–`255`) and `reset` (terminal default).

Per-theme option `transparent_background` (bool): when true, `background` is not painted and the terminal's own background shows through. Users can override it per theme in config.

From spec/SPEC.md §8.2:

Selection is shown with **text brightness and markers**. The one background band is the session selector's focused selection:

- Unselected list rows and transcript sections: `muted_foreground`.
- Selected transcript section and theme-selector row: `foreground`, bold, with a marker (`>` in the theme list, `▒` over the left border in the transcript) in `primary`.
- Session selector (Projects and Sessions lists):
  - Selected row in the **focused** list: the `>` marker in `primary`, never inverted. Everything after the marker is one **inverted** band (`foreground` with the reverse-video modifier, not bold), running up to the row's right margin (two cells before the pane border). Inside the band, the timestamp, live dot, title, gaps and stats all take the band's style.
  - Selected row in the **unfocused** list (e.g. Projects while Sessions has focus): text **bold** in `secondary_foreground`, not inverted; the `>` marker in the same `secondary_foreground` (not bold), so the context stays visible.
- Focused pane border: `ring`; unfocused borders: `border`.
- Selected harness tab: `primary`, underlined; other tabs: `muted_foreground`.
- In the transcript, dimming of unselected sections is controlled by `dim_unselected` (default `true`). When `false`, all sections use their normal token colours and only the marker + bold indicate selection.

From spec/SPEC.md §9.2:

Target: sessions up to **~100 MB** stay smooth.
- Parsing is streaming (line by line for JSONL, paged queries for SQLite) and runs off the UI thread. The UI shows a loading state and becomes interactive as soon as the first screen of content is parsed.
- Large tool outputs: the model stores line counts and byte ranges up front. The full text is materialised only when the section is unfolded, searched, copied or exported.
- Layout is computed lazily per block for the current width. Only blocks overlapping the viewport are rendered.
- Session list stats are computed in the background and cached in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/chronoscope/`, keyed by (path, size, mtime) or by (db, session id, `time_updated`).
- Session discovery reads each Claude transcript at most once per index build. Each file's scan result (cwd, start time, first prompt, last `ai-title`) is kept in memory, keyed by (path, size, mtime). The initial build and live rebuilds rescan only new or changed files, scanning several files in parallel. Results for files that are gone are dropped.
- Budgets (to be measured with benchmarks on a synthetic 100 MB fixture):
  - first content within 300 ms;
  - full parse under 2 s;
  - each frame rendered in under 16 ms;
  - memory use within roughly 3× the file size.

From spec/SPEC.md §9.6:

- Adapter tests use fixture sessions (trimmed real sessions, scrubbed of secrets and personal data) for each harness, including subagents, compaction and live append scenarios.
- Component tests: every component (§1.3) is tested on its own. Its `view` is rendered into a Ratatui `TestBackend` frame and snapshotted with `insta`, and events passed to `on()` (or `Cmd`s to `perform`) are checked against the returned `Msg` / `CmdResult`.
- Update tests: `App::update(Msg)` is checked against the resulting domain state, mounted components and focus, without a terminal.
- Screen snapshot tests render `App::view` into a `TestBackend` with `insta`, for each built-in theme at a fixed size.
- Layout-cache property tests check that heights match the rendered output for random widths and fold states.
- Benchmarks (`criterion`) on a synthetic 100 MB session against the §9.2 budgets.

Planner notes (decisions not in the spec; binding for this task):

- **Where it happens.** The selection changes from many paths (keys, wheel, search, live updates, opening and leaving a subagent). Rather than handling each, `App::update` ends with one cheap sync: it asks the transcript on top for its selected section's turn through a `query` attribute, and pushes the selection to the sidebar when that changed. The attribute push produces no `Msg`, as `SELECTED_ATTR` in `list_pane.rs` does.
- **Only on a change.** Push only when the transcript's selected *section* changed since the last sync. Task 013's wheel relies on this: the sidebar's selection can move on its own to an entry with nothing selectable, while the transcript's selection stays the same.
- **Who it follows for.** The sidebar follows unless it has the focus itself. That includes the time a prompt or overlay has the focus, so an incremental search moves it. From task 012 on, it does not follow while the focus is on the sidebar or on an overlay opened from it; build the check so that task can extend it.
- **A turn without an entry.** A transcript selection can be in a turn that has no entry, on a system section in a turn with only system content. The spec does not define this, so: the sidebar's selection stays where it is. It does not clear and does not jump.
- **Cost.** The lookup from turn id to row is a map, not a scan, because this runs on every key press in a session of thousands of turns.
- **Reveal.** Scrolling the pane to keep the selected row visible uses the same least-scrolling rule as `ListCursor` (§6.1: only as far as needed).
- **Subagents.** The sync reads the transcript on top, so opening and leaving a subagent is covered once the rows have been replaced (task 010). Make sure the order is: rows first, then selection.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Tests cover the selection following the transcript through `j` / `k`, `]` / `[`, page keys and search.
- [ ] Tests cover the selection following through opening and leaving a subagent: the row of the subagent's selected section while open, and the parent's row, as it was, after going back.
- [ ] Tests cover live updates: an appended turn adds a row without moving the selection, and a following transcript's selection is tracked.
- [ ] A test shows that with the transcript away from the end, an appended turn adds a row and neither the selection nor the pane's offset changes.
- [ ] A test shows the selected row stays visible: moving through a list longer than the pane scrolls the pane by the least needed, and scrolling never moves the pane itself (its area is unchanged).
- [ ] A test shows a transcript selection in a turn without an entry leaves the sidebar's selection unchanged.
- [ ] A test shows pushing the selection produces no message: no `Msg` is queued by it.
- [ ] A test shows the transcript's mouse wheel moves the sidebar's selection when it moves the transcript's.
- [ ] A snapshot at 120x40 in the `default` theme shows the browser with the selected row in the unfocused style.
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo test` pass.
- [ ] `cargo test --release -- --ignored budgets --nocapture` stays within budget.
- [ ] Snapshot changes are limited to browser screens at 90 columns or wider, which now show a selected row.

## UI
No new state beyond task 010's. In the running app the sidebar now shows the selected, unfocused row:

- `>` in `secondary_foreground` replaces the `●` (or the first `═`) in column 3.
- The row's text is bold in `secondary_foreground`, not inverted.
- The border stays `border`.

Screen snapshots at 120x40 in the `default` theme: with the selection on a User, an Assistant and a Compaction row, and a long list scrolled to keep the selected row visible.
