# Token usage in the stats footer

## Goal
Make the footer's token figure honest on both harnesses. It currently adds only input and output, which is effectively output alone. `TurnStats.tokens` becomes a `TokenUsage`, the footer shows `tokens` (input + output + cache writes) and a new `cached` part (cache reads), and reasoning is counted once on every harness.

## Spec excerpts
`SPEC.md` below is the cycle 2 specification. `spec/SPEC.md` is the base spec, which describes the application as built. Where the two conflict, `SPEC.md` wins.

From SPEC.md §2:

The footer of an Assistant block becomes:

```
5m 2s · 12 messages · 45.2k tokens · 359.4M cached
```

Unknown parts are left out as today. Cost, when known, stays last (`· $0.42`).

From SPEC.md §2.1:

The footer adds only input and output tokens, which leaves out almost all input. One Claude session recorded 2.8k input, 336k output, 1.2M cache writes and 359M cache reads, so the number is effectively output alone.

Requirements:

- `TurnStats.tokens` is replaced by a `TokenUsage` with `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write` and `reasoning`.
- Each message counts once, using its latest usage, as today.
- `tokens` in the footer = input + output + cache writes.
- `cached` in the footer = cache reads summed over the turn's messages. It is hidden when zero.
- **`output` includes reasoning, on every harness**, and `reasoning` is only an "of which" figure that is never added to a total.
  - Claude: `message.usage.output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens` is already part of `output_tokens` (it never exceeded it in 1438 messages). Do not add it.
  - OpenCode: `tokens.reasoning` is separate from `tokens.output` (one row has reasoning 683, output 120). The adapter adds it to `output`.
- Sources:
  - Claude: `input_tokens`, `output_tokens`, `cache_read_input_tokens`, `cache_creation_input_tokens`.
  - OpenCode: `tokens.input`, `tokens.output`, `tokens.reasoning`, `tokens.cache.read`, `tokens.cache.write`.

From SPEC.md §7:

Every task must pass:

```
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test
```

Tasks that change parsing, the model or rendering must also stay within budget on:

```
cargo test --release -- --ignored budgets --nocapture
```

Snapshot changes are limited to the rows a task intends to change. A snapshot changed by accident is a failure, not something to accept. Two changes are expected to touch many snapshots, and those are still reviewed one by one: the shared duration format (§2.4) changes every snapshot showing a footer or selector-row duration of a minute or longer, and the sidebar changes every browser screen snapshot at 90 columns or wider.

From spec/SPEC.md §3.1:

- Location: `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<session-uuid>.jsonl` (append-only JSONL).
- Directory name is a lossy encoding of the cwd (`/` and `.` → `-`); the real cwd is in each entry's `cwd` field.
- Subagent transcripts: `<session-uuid>/subagents/agent-<agentId>.jsonl` (entries have `isSidechain: true`) + `agent-<agentId>.meta.json` (`agentType`, `description`, `toolUseId`).
  - Linkage: the parent's `Agent` `tool_use.id` equals `meta.toolUseId`, and the matching `tool_result` entry's `toolUseResult.agentId` names the file.
- Relevant entry types: `user`, `assistant`, `system` (e.g. `turn_duration`), `attachment`, `ai-title`, `last-prompt`, `cost-state`.
  Noise to skip: `api-request*`, `mode`, `permission-mode`, `atis-latch`, `file-history-*`.
- Assistant entries carry `message.model`, `effort` / `perTurnEffort`, `timestamp`, `usage`.
- Content blocks: `text`, `thinking` (usually redacted — empty text + signature; ~15% of blocks observed carry readable text), `tool_use`, `server_tool_use`, `advisor_tool_result`; tool results arrive as `tool_result` blocks inside `user` entries, paired by `tool_use_id`.
- Session title available via `ai-title` (written repeatedly; use the **last** one).
- **One JSONL line per content block:** an assistant API response is split over several `assistant` lines sharing `message.id` (BRIO session: 195 lines → 73 messages, up to 16 lines per message).

From spec/SPEC.md §3.2:

- Location: `~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db` (SQLite, WAL mode).
- Tables: `project` (`worktree`, `name`), `session_v2` (`project_id`, `parent_id`, `directory`, `title`, `model`, tokens/cost, timestamps), `session_message` (`session_id`, `type`, `seq`, `data` JSON).
- Message types: `user`, `assistant`, `synthetic`, `system`, `idle`. Assistant `data` has `agent`, `model {id, providerID, variant}`, and a `content` array of `text` / `tool` parts.
- Subagent sessions are linked via `session_v2.parent_id`.

From spec/SPEC.md §5.1:

Harness adapters translate each native format into one shared model:

```
Session { id, harness, project, cwd, title, started_at, turns: [Turn], children: [SessionRef] }
Turn    = User      { timestamp, text, items: [Item] }     // items: injected content preceding/attached to the prompt
        | Assistant { timestamp, model, effort?, items: [Item], stats? }
        | Compaction{ timestamp, summary }
Item    = Text(markdown)
        | Injected { entries: [{ kind, timestamp, text }] }   // §5.6; consecutive entries collapsed
        | Thinking(text | Redacted)
        | ToolCall { id, tool: ToolKind, description, input, result?: ToolResult, status, duration? }
ToolKind = Shell | Read | Write | Edit | Grep | Glob | WebFetch | WebSearch | Subagent | Other(name)
```

Turn assembly (Claude):
1. A **User turn** starts at a `user` entry that is a human prompt: `origin.kind == "human"` (or, for older versions without `origin`, string/text content with no `tool_result` and no `isMeta`). A message typed while the agent is working is stored as an `attachment` of kind `queued_command` with `origin.kind == "human"`; it also starts a User turn, and the content after it forms a new Assistant turn.
2. Everything up to the next human prompt forms **one Assistant turn**: `assistant` lines, `tool_result`-only `user` lines, and allowlisted injected content (§5.6).
3. `assistant` lines with the same `message.id` are merged into one message, keeping their content blocks in order. Repeated blocks (same `tool_use.id`, or same index for text/thinking) replace the earlier version instead of being duplicated.
4. `tool_result` blocks are attached to the `ToolCall` with the matching `tool_use_id`. A tool call without a result yet has status `pending`.
5. The model shown in the Assistant title is that of the turn's first message. If the model changes within a turn, the new model is shown as a muted inline note.
6. `system` `turn_duration` entries become the stats footer of the preceding Assistant turn.

Turn assembly (OpenCode): each `user` row (with `synthetic` rows treated as injected content) starts a turn. `assistant` rows up to the next `user` row form the Assistant turn. Tool calls and their results are already combined in each `tool` part (`state.input`, `state.content`, `state.status`).

- Tool names are mapped to `ToolKind` per harness (e.g. Claude `Bash` and OpenCode `shell` → `Shell`; Claude `Agent`/`Task` and OpenCode `subagent` → `Subagent`).
- Tool description: the tool's own `description` input if present (Claude Bash). Otherwise a derived label (`Read src/main.rs`, `Grep "pattern" in path`, `WebFetch example.com/…`, `<tool name>` for unknown tools).
- `effort` is shown only when the harness records it (Claude `effort`; OpenCode `model.variant` when it isn't `default`).

From spec/SPEC.md §1.3:

**Every custom UI element is its own component.** The code is organised around components, not around long render functions or a central key handler.

- A component implements tui-realm's `Component` trait (`view`, `query`/`attr`, `state`, `perform(Cmd) -> CmdResult`), plus `AppComponent` (`on(&Event) -> Option<Msg>`) if it handles events. An element that appears on several screens (e.g. the help line) is one component type, mounted with different props.
- A component draws only itself. Its `view` draws its own border and content, and leaves sub-elements to child types: a child component it owns, or a small `Widget`/`StatefulWidget` type.
- **No long render functions.** A render function (`view`, or a helper it calls) that draws more than one distinct element, or grows past about 50 lines, is split into smaller components or widgets. Rendering has no side effects.
- Components are `pub` types that can be built from plain data (props and the theme) and rendered into a `TestBackend` frame on their own, without an `Application` or a terminal (§9.6).
- All colours and modifiers come from theme tokens (§8.1), passed in as a prop. Components never hard-code colours.
- `tui-realm-stdlib` is not used. The look in §4 and §8 is specific enough that wrapping stdlib components would mean overriding their rendering. Prompt text editing uses `tui-input` inside the `Prompt` component.

From spec/SPEC.md §5.2:

Each turn is rendered as a rounded block. Its title shows the role on the left and the timestamp on the right. Assistant blocks also show `model @ effort` after the role. A **section** is the unit of selection, folding, copying and saving.

| Section | Default fold | Folded shows | Unfolded shows |
|---|---|---|---|
| User prompt | Folded | First 2 lines + `…` | Full prompt |
| Assistant text | Not foldable | n/a | Rendered markdown |
| Thinking (readable) | Folded | `Thinking` + first line, muted | Full text, muted |
| Thinking (redacted) | Not shown | n/a | n/a |
| Tool call | Folded | `> <description>` | Description, then per-tool body (§5.3) |
| Subagent call | Folded | `> <description>` + agent name | Prompt + final result + "open transcript" hint (§5.4) |
| Turn stats footer | Not foldable | One muted line: duration · messages · tokens/cost (if available) | n/a |
| Compaction marker | Folded | Divider `── context compacted ──` | Summary text |
| System / injected | Folded | Muted one-liner: kind + first line | Full content, muted |

Redacted thinking (no readable text) is kept in the model (§5.1) but is not a section. It is not drawn, selected, searched, copied or exported, because it has nothing to show. A turn whose only content is redacted thinking is drawn as an empty block.

The folded/unfolded marker prefix is `▶` when folded and `▼` when unfolded (the sketch uses `>` and `-`).

Every section's text starts at the same column, two cells in from the block's padding:
- Foldable sections put their marker (`▶`/`▼` and a space) in those two cells.
- All other non-foldable lines (assistant text, `model → …` notes, the turn stats footer) are indented by two spaces.

From spec/SPEC.md §8.1:

Two layers, modelled on ratcn's shadcn-inspired `Theme`:

1. **Base roles** (required in a theme file): `name`, `foreground`, `muted_foreground`, `background`, `surface`, `field`, `primary`, `primary_foreground`, `secondary`, `secondary_foreground`, `accent`, `destructive`, `destructive_foreground`, `warning`, `border`, `ring`, `cursor`.
2. **Component tokens** (optional overrides; each derived from a base role by default): see the table below.

| Token | Default | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `user_title` | `primary` | `User` block title |
| `assistant_title` | `accent` | `Assistant` block title, model @ effort |
| `system_title` | `muted_foreground` | System / compaction block titles |
| `timestamp` | `muted_foreground` | Right-aligned block titles |
| `tool_description` | `foreground` | `> description` lines |
| `label` | `muted_foreground` | `Command:` / `Result:` labels |
| `command` | `foreground` | Command / tool input text |
| `output` | `muted_foreground` | Tool results |
| `error_output` | `destructive` | Failed tool results |
| `diff_added` / `diff_removed` | `primary` / `destructive` | Edit diffs |
| `thinking` | `muted_foreground` | Thinking text |
| `selection_marker` | `primary` | `▒` and `>` markers |
| `search_match` | fg `primary_foreground` on `primary` | Search hits (the only explicit background colour; the selector's focused selection uses reverse video, §8.2) |
| `help_key` / `help_text` | `primary` / `muted_foreground` | Help line and help overlay |
| `toast` | fg `foreground` on `surface` | Toast notifications |
| `syntax.*` | derived from `accent`, `primary`, `secondary`, `warning` | Code-block syntax highlighting |

Colours accept `#rrggbb`, ANSI names (`red`, `bright_blue`, …), ANSI indices (`0`–`255`) and `reset` (terminal default).

Per-theme option `transparent_background` (bool): when true, `background` is not painted and the terminal's own background shows through. Users can override it per theme in config.

From spec/SPEC.md §8.2:

Selection is shown with **text brightness and markers**. The one background band is the session selector's focused selection:

- Unselected list rows and transcript sections: `muted_foreground`.
- Selected transcript section and theme-selector row: `foreground`, bold, with a marker (`>` in the theme list, `▒` over the left border in the transcript) in `primary`.
- Session selector (Projects and Sessions lists):
  - Selected row in the **focused** list: the `>` marker in `primary`, never inverted. Everything after the marker is one **inverted** band (`foreground` with the reverse-video modifier, not bold), running up to the row's right margin (two cells before the pane border). Inside the band, the timestamp, live dot, title, gaps and stats all take the band's style.
  - Selected row in the **unfocused** list (e.g. Projects while Sessions has focus): text **bold** in `secondary_foreground`, not inverted; the `>` marker in the same `secondary_foreground` (not bold), so the context stays visible.
- Focused pane border: `ring`; unfocused borders: `border`.
- Selected harness tab: `primary`, underlined; other tabs: `muted_foreground`.
- In the transcript, dimming of unselected sections is controlled by `dim_unselected` (default `true`). When `false`, all sections use their normal token colours and only the marker + bold indicate selection.

From spec/SPEC.md §6.2 (transcript search):

- `/` opens a query in the help line. Matching is smart-case substring (case-insensitive unless the query contains an uppercase letter).
- Searches **all** text, including folded sections, tool input/output and system content.
- `Enter` confirms and jumps to the first match; `n` / `N` go to the next / previous match. All matches are highlighted with `search_match`, and the help line shows `3/17`.
- Jumping to a match inside a folded section unfolds it temporarily. It refolds when the selection moves to a different section, unless the user unfolded it explicitly in the meantime.
- `ESC` clears the search and highlights.

From spec/SPEC.md §9.2:

Target: sessions up to **~100 MB** stay smooth.
- Parsing is streaming (line by line for JSONL, paged queries for SQLite) and runs off the UI thread. The UI shows a loading state and becomes interactive as soon as the first screen of content is parsed.
- Large tool outputs: the model stores line counts and byte ranges up front. The full text is materialised only when the section is unfolded, searched, copied or exported.
- Layout is computed lazily per block for the current width. Only blocks overlapping the viewport are rendered.
- Session list stats are computed in the background and cached in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/chronoscope/`, keyed by (path, size, mtime) or by (db, session id, `time_updated`).
- Session discovery reads each Claude transcript at most once per index build. Each file's scan result (cwd, start time, first prompt, last `ai-title`) is kept in memory, keyed by (path, size, mtime). The initial build and live rebuilds rescan only new or changed files, scanning several files in parallel. Results for files that are gone are dropped.
- Budgets (to be measured with benchmarks on a synthetic 100 MB fixture):
  - first content within 300 ms;
  - full parse under 2 s;
  - each frame rendered in under 16 ms;
  - memory use within roughly 3× the file size.

From spec/SPEC.md §9.5 (robustness):

- Never writes to harness data. The SQLite database is opened read-only.
- Unknown entry types, unknown content blocks and malformed lines are skipped and counted, not fatal.
  - A muted `N entries could not be parsed` note appears in the browser header.
  - Session metadata entries (known ones such as `agent-name`, `queue-operation`, `continued-in`, `bridge-session`, `tools-used`, and unknown types without a `message`) carry no conversation content: they are skipped and logged, but not counted in the note.
  - Details are written to a log file at `$XDG_STATE_HOME/chronoscope/chronoscope.log`.
- The schema version is checked on open (OpenCode `migration` table / Claude `version` field). An unknown newer version logs a warning, and Chronoscope still tries best-effort parsing.
- Terminal state is always restored on exit, panic or signal (panic hook + raw-mode guard).

From spec/SPEC.md §9.6:

- Adapter tests use fixture sessions (trimmed real sessions, scrubbed of secrets and personal data) for each harness, including subagents, compaction and live append scenarios.
- Component tests: every component (§1.3) is tested on its own. Its `view` is rendered into a Ratatui `TestBackend` frame and snapshotted with `insta`, and events passed to `on()` (or `Cmd`s to `perform`) are checked against the returned `Msg` / `CmdResult`.
- Update tests: `App::update(Msg)` is checked against the resulting domain state, mounted components and focus, without a terminal.
- Screen snapshot tests render `App::view` into a `TestBackend` with `insta`, for each built-in theme at a fixed size.
- Layout-cache property tests check that heights match the rendered output for random widths and fold states.
- Benchmarks (`criterion`) on a synthetic 100 MB session against the §9.2 budgets.

Planner notes (decisions not in the spec; binding for this task):

- `TokenUsage` is a public type in `src/model/mod.rs` with `u64` fields `input`, `output`, `cache_read`, `cache_write` and `reasoning`. It has a method for the footer's total (input + output + cache writes). `TurnStats.tokens` becomes `Option<TokenUsage>`, `None` when no usage is known, so an unknown part is still left out.
- Footer order: `<duration> · <n> messages · <tokens> tokens · <cached> cached · $<cost>`. `tokens` keeps today's singular (`1 token`) and uses `format_tokens`, as does `cached`.
- Claude: `reasoning` comes from `message.usage.output_tokens_details.thinking_tokens`. A missing number counts as zero. The `Builder.usage` map in `src/harness/claude/assemble.rs` keeps the latest `TokenUsage` per message id, and later lines still update stats that already exist.
- OpenCode: `Contribution.tokens` in `src/harness/opencode/assemble.rs` carries a `TokenUsage`; a row updated in place still replaces its share. `output` is `tokens.output + tokens.reasoning`.
- A wire field added by this task must not turn a line or row that parses today into an unparsed one. A value of an unexpected JSON type counts as missing (`wire::Entry` and `AssistantData` otherwise fail the whole line or row on a wrong type).
- Existing tests that assert the old totals are expected to change, for example `tests/claude_assembly.rs` and `src/harness/opencode/tests.rs` (`Some(3300)`, `Some(880)`). `tests/fixtures/README.md` says the cache counts in `claude/session.jsonl` "must not be summed"; correct that sentence.
- Fixtures that build a `TurnStats` directly (`src/components/turn_block/fixtures.rs`, `src/app/fixtures.rs`) keep showing the same footer text unless a test is about `cached`, so unrelated snapshots do not move.

## Acceptance criteria
- [ ] Assembler tests cover: cache tokens on both harnesses; each message counted once when its lines repeat; Claude thinking tokens not added to output; OpenCode reasoning added to output.
- [ ] `format_stats` tests cover `cached` shown and hidden, and cost remaining last.
- [ ] Footer search still works: the searched text matches the footer as displayed. A test searches for text in the `cached` part and finds it highlighted on the footer row.
- [ ] A test uses the figures from the spec's example: 2.8k input, 336k output, 1.2M cache writes and 359M cache reads give `1.5M tokens · 359.0M cached`.
- [ ] Assembler tests on both harnesses show that a usage field of an unexpected JSON type leaves the line or row parsed, is not counted in `unparsed_count`, and treats the field as missing.
- [ ] A turn with no usage at all shows no token part and no `cached` part.
- [ ] `TurnStats.tokens` no longer has type `Option<u64>`, and no code adds `reasoning` to a total.
- [ ] `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` and `cargo test` pass.
- [ ] `cargo test --release -- --ignored budgets --nocapture` stays within budget.
- [ ] Snapshot changes are limited to footer rows whose token figures change.

## UI
The stats footer of an Assistant block is one muted row (`muted_foreground`), word-wrapped and indented by two spaces as today:

```
5m 2s · 12 messages · 45.2k tokens · 359.4M cached
```

- `· <n> cached` is left out when cache reads are zero.
- `· $0.42` stays last when the cost is known.

Snapshots: a block whose footer has `cached`, and one with `cached` and cost, at block widths 80 and 120.
